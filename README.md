## Usage

- Use git clone to build the app. 

- Make sure to get your own api and add it into the **.env**.

- The app was motivated from [Brad from Traversy Media]

### Limitations

- Some songs don't have any lyrics or their lyrics were not updated by the MusicXMatch so our application gives us error.

- Others are all good.

- Deleted the app from heroku. 

- All components and others are fine.
